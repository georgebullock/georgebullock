<h1 align="left">Hi 👋, I'm George</h1>
<h2 align="left">A frontend developer in Berlin, Germany</h2>

Altogether, I've acquired 10 years of experience working for media and technology companies. I started my career in finance and business development. Post-Grad, I switched to marketing and did growth-oriented marketing for startups. My focuses were user acquisition and conversion optimization.

The technical side of marketing inspired me to study design and web development. In mid-2015, I started teaching myself UX design, UI Design, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript after work. A few months later I decided to become a frontend developer.

To speed up my transition, I took a sabbatical for most of 2016 to study design and web technology full time. Besides teaching myself, that summer I completed a full-time web development boot camp. In October 2016, I started applying for frontend development jobs. A month later I landed a frontend job at IBM iX / Aperto

After three years and five months at IBM iX / Aperto, I resigned to pursue the next step in my career. I'm currently seeking a mid-level frontend developer role, in Berlin, at a product company where I can work on a single page application full time.

I earned an MBA from EDHEC Business School in France and a B.S. in Business Administration, with an emphasis on finance, from California State University, Los Angeles.

I'm also a Project Management Institute Agile Certified Practitioner (PMI - ACP) certificate holder.
