<h1 align="left">Hi 👋, I'm George</h1>

<h2 align="left">A product manager in Berlin, Germany</h2>

I’m a senior IC-track product leader with strong technical and business backgrounds. Motivated by building high-value, differentiated, products and aligning cross-functional teams towards achieving clear strategic objectives.

I started my career in finance and business development, then transitioned into growth-oriented marketing, focusing on user acquisition and conversion optimization. Technical marketing work led me to frontend development, where I spent five years building digital experiences at IBM iX, and Aroundhome, before moving into product management.

Currently, I’m a Senior Product Manager at Staffbase, where I own Social and Community feature development within the App / Intranet group. I work closely with senior engineering, design, and business stakeholders to define product vision, strategy, and roadmaps, and to align priorities across teams. My objective is to create business value by increasing employee engagement via deep understanding of user needs, informed by user research and close collaboration with stakeholders.

Previously, I owned Staffbase’s external comms product, taking it from proof-of-concept, to closed beta, and open beta before a strategic pivot away from external comms. Before that, I was Product Lead at mobileJobs, where I launched two products via close collaboration with GTM leadership, resulting in new customer acquisition and higher NRR. I also led product due diligence for M&A.

I hold an MBA from EDHEC Business School and a B.S. in Finance from California State University, Los Angeles. I’m also a PMI Agile Certified Practitioner (PMI-ACP®).

I'm committed to staying on the IC track in senior or lead / staff product management roles that don't have direct reports.
