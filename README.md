<h1 align="left">Hi 👋, I'm George</h1>
<h2 align="left">A product manager in Berlin, Germany</h2>

I'm a business professional with strong information technology skills.

I have over 10 years of experience working for media and technology companies. I started my career in finance and business development. Post-Grad, I switched to marketing and did growth-oriented marketing for startups. My focuses were user acquisition and conversion optimization.

The technical side of marketing inspired me to study design and web development. In mid-2015, I started teaching myself UX design, UI Design, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript after work. A few months later, I decided to become a frontend developer.

To speed up my transition, I took a sabbatical for most of 2016 to study design and web technology full time. Besides teaching myself, I completed a full-time web development boot camp. In October, I started applying for frontend development jobs. A month later I landed my first frontend job at IBM iX.

After ~5 years in frontend engineering, I decided to make a lateral move into product management to apply my business and technical skills to aligning people and driving business outcomes.

Now, I'm a product manager at mobileJobs, which is a SaaS recruiting solution and marketplace for blue-collar talent. I'm responsible for the B2C side of the product making sure blue-collar job applicants have delightful application experiences resulting in job offers.

I earned an MBA from EDHEC Business School in France. I also hold a B.S. in Business Administration, with an emphasis on finance, from California State University, Los Angeles. And I'm a Project Management Institute Agile Certified Practitioner (PMI - ACP) certificate holder.
